    <ul id="repo-list">
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/KateTorres/tts-pdf-to-text-openai"> tts-pdf-to-text-openai </a>: PDF text extraction tool that allows users to convert text from PDF files and extract them using OpenAI's API or locally. The tool supports page range selection, automatic logging, and model selection (GPT-3.5-Turbo or GPT-4o) for efficient processing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/KateTorres/tts-audio-automation">tts-audio-automation</a>: Python-based tool that automates the process of converting .txt files into high-quality audio files using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. It was written for my blind dad to read notes and texts using AI voice that he selected. My dad speaks only Russian, while I speak English, therefore both Russian and English languages are supported.

            <a href="https://github.com/KateTorres/stability-mab-arrhenius"> stability-mab-arrhenius </a>: This is one of my earlier projects. I wanted to create "play" data for practicing machine learnig and other type of analysis. This is a Flask-based web application for generating synthetic stability data for monoclonal antibodies using kinetic modeling. The application allows users to enter specific parameters and generate synthetic data along with prediction intervals, which are then plotted and displayed in a new browser window. The generated data can also be downloaded as a CSV file.
