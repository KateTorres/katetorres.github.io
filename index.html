<p>
    I am a chemist with experience in the pharmaceutical industry, specializing in analytical chemistry, laboratory automation, and data analytics. Midway through my career, I developed an interest in data-driven methodologies, backend development, and cloud computing, leading me to expand my expertise in machine learning, AWS architecture, and Cybersecurity.
<p>
    Many of my professional projects focused on the electronic separation of silicone oil in microscopy images and laboratory robotics automation, though these remain proprietary to my previous employer. The projects showcased here represent my personal exploration of Python, AI-driven data analysis, and algorithmic development, reflecting my continuous learning.
